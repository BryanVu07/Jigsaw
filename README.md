# README - MIE243 Mechanical Design Project

Course: Mechanical Design (MIE243)

Project Name: 
MIE243 – Dissection 1: Ball Bearing  
MIE243 – Dissection 2: Jigsaw

Course Objectives:
The purpose of this project aligns with three core objectives:
1. Hands-on Experience: We’re given the opportunity to physically handle and dissect real-world components, mechanisms, and consumer products.
2. Drafting & CAD Skills: This course focuses heavily on developing drafting skills and transitioning into CAD/SolidWorks for accurate modeling.
3. Conceptual Design Practice: By using dissected parts and building upon SolidWorks knowledge, we get to explore the early stages of conceptual design.

Introduction:

For Dissection 1, my group and I explored a simple ball bearing mechanism to practice our hand-drafting skills and measurements. The experience helped us understand fundamental mechanical concepts and laid the groundwork for more complex dissections.

Moving forward to Dissection 2, we’re tasked with dissecting a jigsaw, a more intricate mechanism. The jigsaw uses a reciprocating blade to cut through wood and light metals. This dissection will not only improve our CAD proficiency but also enhance our understanding of mechanical systems and how to translate real components into solid models. 

This week, we’ll continue our work using **SolidWorks**, focusing on modeling the mechanism responsible for converting rotational to linear motion within the jigsaw. This project marks the last dissection where we strictly recreate an existing product; future projects will shift focus towards modifications and redesigns.

General Instructions:
1. Divide CAD Work: It's essential to share CAD modeling tasks within the group to develop individual skills. Each member should maintain a record of their work for their individual portfolio.
2. Group Deliverables: The deliverable for this dissection is a group submission, with individual portfolios to be submitted later. Instructions for submission are available on Quercus.
3. Practical Sessions: We’ll begin each session with a SolidWorks tutorial, followed by the jigsaw dissection. This time, we will take more responsibility in understanding the product’s functionality and gathering precise measurements.
4. Safety Precautions: As jigsaws contain grease, wearing protective clothing is recommended. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling the components.


Deliverables:

For Dissection 2, our submission must include:

1. CAD Models: 
   - Create a solid model of the **rotational-to-linear motion conversion mechanism**, including major sub-parts, with accurate measurements from the dissection.
   - Exclude non-critical features like the motor and casing.
   - Identify any estimated measurements and simplifications made.
   - Submission must include: 
     - The 3D SolidWorks model files for the assembly.
     - 4-6 2D drawings showing key details of the mechanism.

2. Questions (in a separate document): 
   - Answer a set of questions related to the design and function of the jigsaw mechanism. These cover topics like motor shaft motion, motion transmission, external forces, and potential failure points.

Conclusion:
This project is a great way to integrate hands-on mechanical dissection with CAD skills, building the foundation for future mechanical design work. Through careful disassembly, modeling, and analysis, we’ll gain valuable experience in how everyday mechanisms work and how to represent them accurately through CAD software.
